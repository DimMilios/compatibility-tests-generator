# Unofficial MusicXML test suite by Lilypond
The goal of this project is to explore whether full compatibility
between the MusicXML and Humdrum/kern music representations formats is supported.
The results of the music sheet rendering in the two formats cannot be compared in an
automated manner.

The process followed is:
- Gather all of the image results generated by the Unofficial Lilypond test suite.
- Import every MusicXML test file through Verovio Humdrum Viewer, 
- Convert from MusicXML to Humdrum
- and save the music sheet rendered by the program as an image.
- Also, save the kern that was generated from the conversion.
- Lastly, generate the markdown file here and compare for visual differences or errors
between a pair of images of the corresponding MusicXML test.
